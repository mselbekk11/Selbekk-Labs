I want my contact form to not only save to my convex database (which it does) I want resend to email me the form submissions. Resend is tested and it works:

api end point: /Users/morgan/projects/selbekk-labs/app/api/send/route.ts
email template: /Users/morgan/projects/selbekk-labs/app/components/email-template.tsx

Please set me up another endpoint that sends this new email template I have created:

/Users/morgan/projects/selbekk-labs/app/components/email-template-two.tsx

it currently has some errors and doesnt work correctly yet as i tried to edit it enough to help you show what data i wanted. Essentially i want you to send the data from the form submition into this email template.

Is there anything else im missing i need to consider?
